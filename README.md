Module 14 challenge

In the folder:
1. in the static/js folder is the "app.js" completed homework file 
2. the "index.html" file that is being referenced for the github page
3. the starter "samples.json" file

The github page is located: https://ramirezmaribel.github.io/belly-button-challenge/ and works exactly as when the index.html file is opened in a live server
